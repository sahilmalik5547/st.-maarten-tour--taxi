                tour in St. Maarten so wonderful. You really went above and beyond to give us such a fantastic sighting
                seeing of the island. We especially enjoyed your great company during your tour. We have so many neat
                memories of that day and learned so much from you. So enjoyed your friend Calvin with the sea shells. I
                will treasure them and have chosen certain ones for special gifts for my friends here. We would love you
                to extend our thanks to Calvin. So glad we took picture of you and Calvin so we can share them with
                everyone here and tell them about our new friends we have in St. Maarten. So looking forward to doing it
                again on our next cruise." </p> <br>

            <p>"If anyone has a large group, you need to call Fitzroy. We had a wedding weekend and had 40 guests.
                Fitzroy, Junior, and the entire gang took care of us wherever we had to go. Fitzroy was super responsive
                (even by email), and he and his team were 100% dependable. Their pricing was very reasonable and their
                vans are much more luxurious, comfortable and spacious than any of the cabs we saw. They had no problems
                getting up and down the hills of Anse Marcel. Top notch service from top notch guys. Thanks so much, and
                we can’t wait to come back and call you guys again." </p> <br>

            <p>"we had a group of 6 from the Carnival Freedom and we were just looking for a ride to Airplane beach and
                over to the nude beach. so we got of the boat and headed to the taxi line and we were greeted by this
                lovely little lady and she said she would take care of all our needs, she said just call me MOMMA. She
                was the best taxi drive you could have ever asked for. She took us every where we wanted to go and stay
                with our all day!!! She sang and danced with us and treated us like her own family!! So from now on we
                will always ask for Mommy..She is TAXI #379.. THANK YOU MOMMA for all you did for us!!!" </p> <br>

            <p>"Thanks for the Great Tour!! Fitzroy was waiting at the pier to give us a Private Tour in a very nice
                clean van with air. He took us all over the island stopping often for pictures. We went to the best
                beach in Grand Case and had it almost to ourselves. He also got us to Maho beach in time to see several
                big planes landing. He was a very safe driver and I recommend this tour to anyone stopping here for the
                day on a cruise." </p> <br>
